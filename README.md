This is a collection of Datasets that includes Health Related Headlines,Titles and Teaser of News,Journals scrapped from the web

The datasets are suitable for NLP tasks like Topic Modelling, Sentiment analysis, Word Visualization and whatever creative NLP task the users can imagine.

Working on this took many hours but I consider this my opportunity to give back to the internet that has given so much knowledge to me

I hope both people from health sciences and other fields can relate with and do NLP magic with the datasets
